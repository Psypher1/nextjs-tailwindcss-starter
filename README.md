<h1 align="center">Next.js Tailwind Starter</h1>

This is a starter for things I keep doing when I create a Next.js project. I'm just tired of setting it up every time.

This starter consists of:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
  - Tailwind Typography
  - Prettier Plugin Tailwind
- [next-seo](https://github.com/garmeeh/next-seo)
